# 2FP UV measurment

Simple data display measuing 3 spectral UV channels

UVA (320-400nm), UVB (280-320nm), and UVC (200-280nm) 

High Dynamic Range: Up to 3.43E+10 (resolution multiplied by gain range)

accuracy of up to 24-bit signal resolution

irradiance responsivity per count down to 2.38 nW/cm² at 64 ms integration time.

displayed in μW/cm²
