# Low cost OD600 spectrometer for enrichment and culture growth measurement in the field

We've developed this minimal device for monitoring growth of liquid cultures in tubes. Optical density at a wavelength of 600nm, or _OD600_, is a common tool for measuring relative microbial growth in (semi-)transparent liquid media. It is based on light scattering (more than absorbance) by cells in the  orange-yellow range. While there is variance for different organisms and different instruments, it is a simple noninvasive method to rapidly measure culture growth over time. 

Thanks to improvements in LED effeciency and light sensors, this minimal design is accurate enough for field growth of small volumes liquid culture in 15ml centerfuge tubes.

Code adapted from the excellent [Adafruit_TSL2591](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_TSL2591_Library/blob/master/examples/tsl2591/tsl2591.ino) and [OLED](https://learn.adafruit.com/monochrome-oled-breakouts/arduino-library-and-examples) examples. 


## Overview

__Cost:__ ~30$ (as of 2022) per unit, <$50 to make just one including shipping

__Material lead time:__ Several weeks for the cheapest sources and shipping costs 

__Time:__ An hour to a day, depending on skill level

__Tools:__ Soldering, wire crimping, or breadboard, access to a 3d printer (or double the cost and order a print).  

__Skills:__ Simple electronics wiring, load code into an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, ability to outsource or FDM 3d print a model 

This simple design doesn't take much background to make. Ask around at your local Makerspace, library, or engineering department if you don't yet have these abilities yourself, there are a entire communities of people out there who are interested in sharing these skills. 

This design is similar to others also developed around near-monochromatic LEDs and the TSL2591 light sensor.  This article is a great starting place that we have expanded for our needs.

## Build instructions

Preparation

1. Order / collect parts
2. Set up computer with [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/) and 3d slicer and control software (see [arduino_install.sh](arduino_install.sh) for an example. Install all needed boards and both the the Adafruit_TSL2591 library and adafruit_GFX library. 
3. 3d print (or order) the part(s) found here: [OD600_15mlFalcon.stl](OD600_15mlFalcon.stl)

Assembly

4. Use breadboard or crimp cables or soldering to make circuit. 
5. Use Arduino IDE to load program into Arduino
6. Assemble LED and sensor on opposite sides of the 3d part with screws. 
7. Cut and tape the black paper into a cylinder that just fits around your 15ml tube. Remove and and use a holepunch to make hole you can align inside the 3d part between the LED and sensor. 

Use

8. Plug in the Arduino to USB power. Insert blank for zeropoint, insert cultures for OD600 measurements.

### Improvements currently in development

- Calibration to zero and max absorbance, recording blanking values
- Automated and manual sensitivity ranging (LED PWM, acquisition time)
- Trigger USB keyboard emulated typing of the OD with a button press (when plugged into a laptop, for automated transcribing of values).
- Multi-tube swappable size adapters 
- 3d printed case
