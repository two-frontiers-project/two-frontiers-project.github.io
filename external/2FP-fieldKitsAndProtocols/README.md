# Other Field Kits

Details on open source field kits and associated protocols we have generated for use by the scientific community

This resource is actively under development as we formalize our kits. Currently, we only list two that we have successfully had used by outside teams:

1. kit_10sample_collection-nobanking_protocol -- metadata, kit contents, and protocol for collecting samples without banking for DNA sequencing and culturing in the field (this will happen when kits are received at the lab).

2. citizen_science_extremophiles_in_the_home -- Documentation for the following Citizen Science project: https://citsci.org/projects/the-extremophile-campaign-in-your-home
