# Other Field Kits

This repository contains supplemental field kit documentation maintained by the 2 Frontiers Project. Each kit can be assembled from readily available components and is provided with protocols and metadata so that other labs can reproduce our sampling strategies.

## Repository layout

- **kit_10sample_collection-nobanking** – resources for collecting up to ten samples when cold-chain storage is not available. Contains a materials spreadsheet, metadata, and a step-by-step protocol.
- **citizen_science_extremophiles_in_the_home** – outreach materials and datasheets for the "Extremophiles in Your Home" citizen science campaign.

Each folder is self-contained. See the README inside each directory for specifics about the files provided.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have improvements or new protocols to share.
