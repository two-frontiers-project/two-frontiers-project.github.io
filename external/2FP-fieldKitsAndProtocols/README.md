# 2FP Open Source Field Kits Design

Details on open source field kits and associated protocols for use by the scientific community

This resource is actively under development as we formalize our kits.

Shortly, we'll be updating this with where you can order different items, additional kits and protocols, and the like. Happy sampling!

Current contents:

1. Expedition planning template (home directory) -- This is a template we use for planning expeditions. It has our standard formats for the team members, budgeting, packed kits, and debriefing. This sheet does not typically contain detailed kit inventories; it's meant to "link out" to those, which are stored in separate external documents (like the example csv in the 10sample_collection kit here).

2. kit_10sample_collection-nobanking_protocol -- metadata, kit contents, and protocol for collecting samples without banking for DNA sequencing and culturing in the field (this will happen when kits are received at the lab).

3. citizen_science_extremophiles_in_the_home -- Documentation for the following Citizen Science project: https://citsci.org/projects/the-extremophile-campaign-in-your-home
 
Coming soon:

3. In-field culturing

4. In-field sequencing

5. Packing lists for A) Tropical sampling B) Underwater sampling C) High-altitude/cold weather sampling
