# Extremophiles In Your Home

This directory houses outreach materials and templates for the citizen science project exploring extremophiles in household environments. The documents were designed for educators and participants to easily print or modify.

All files are provided as-is and may be adapted for local outreach efforts. For details on how the campaign was conducted, consult the "Guidelines for Exploration" PDF.
