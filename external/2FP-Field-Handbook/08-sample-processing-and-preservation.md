# Sample Processing and Preservation

## Background
Sample Processing and Preservation outlines the standardized procedures for handling environmental sample types — sediment, soil, water, coral, biomass, and plant material — collected during field-work. The goal is to maximize microbial recovery, maintain sample integrity for both culture-dependent and culture-independent analyses, and ensure reproducibility and traceability across teams and sites.

All processing should be completed within 24 hours of [sample collection](06-sample-collection.md) unless otherwise specified. Work must be conducted using sterile technique, appropriate PPE, and in full compliance with the 2FP sample tracking system. This system uses pre-generated CUAL-IDs (CIDs), unique identifiers assigned during [Sample Check-In](07-sample-check-in.md), to ensure every sample remains linked to its complete metadata record. Within 2FP, these are referred to as Two Frontiers IDs (TFIDs), but for clarity they are called CIDs in this document.

Processing should be done in a clean workspace, sanitized before use with 10% bleach (5–10 minutes contact time) followed by 70–80% ethanol. Wear a lab coat, gloves, and any additional PPE appropriate for the environment. Unless conditions in the field prevent it (such as on a vessel), always process samples in a sterile field, using either a clean bench or a portable hood; if neither is available, a flame may be used for sterile work. Keep all tools, containers, and reagents organized to reduce handling time and risk of contamination.

## Protocols

## Sample Processing

### Sediment
#### Initial Handling
1. Remove sediment from blue ice or fridge. The sediment sample will be in a 4 oz Whirl-pak.
2. Check if a CID is assigned to the sample.
3. If not already present, add ambient site water or sterile diH₂O to bring volume to ~15.0 mL, not exceeding a 1:1 sediment-to-liquid ratio.
#### Preparation
4. Check if the seal on the sample is secure.
5. Invert for 30 seconds to homogenize the sample.
6. Return the sample to 4C or on ice.

### Biomass
#### Initial Handling
1. Remove biomass from ice or fridge. The biomass sample will be in a 4 oz Whirl-pak or, depending on available collection materials, a 25-50ml plastic conical or similar container.
2. Check if a CID is assigned to the sample.
3. If not already present, add ambient site water or sterile diH₂O to bring volume to ~15.0 mL, not exceeding a 1:1 biomass-to-liquid ratio.
#### Preparation
4. Check if the seal on the sample is secure.
5. Invert for 30 seconds to homogenize the sample.
6. Return the sample to 4C or on blue ice.

### Soil
#### Initial Handling
1. Remove soil from blue ice or fridge. The soil sample will be in a 4 oz Whirl-pak.
2. Check if a CID is assigned to the sample.
3. If not already present, add ambient site water or sterile diH₂O to bring volume to ~15.0 mL, not exceeding a 1:1 soil-to-liquid ratio.
#### Preparation
4. Check if the seal on the sample is secure.
5. Invert for 30 seconds to homogenize the sample.
6. Return the sample to 4C or on blue ice.

### Water
#### Initial Handling
1. Remove water from blue ice or fridge. The water sample will be in a 1 Liter Whirl-Pak.
2. Check if a CID is assigned to the sample.
3. Gently shake the bag to resuspend the sample. Place the Whirl-pak in a stand to ensure it stands up-right.

### Filtration

#### Filter Assembly
4. Wear nitrile gloves.
5. Attach a rubber stopper to the top of the vacuum flask.
6. Attach a disposable filter funnel to the rubber stopper by inserting the stem of the funnel hood into the stopper. This creates an airtight seal.

#### Water Filtration
7. Ensure the filter funnel is assembled with a 0.22 μm filter membrane in place.
8. With the Whirl-pak mixed, slowly and carefully open it.
9. Pour the water slowly into the filter funnel, pause to gently mix the water if it starts to settle in the Whirl-pak.
10. Wear clean gloves to handle any part of the filter or funnel interior (the outside of the funnel/flask can be handled with ungloved or previously used gloves, since it’s downstream of the filter.
11. Stop once filled with about 3 cm of space at the top (do not overflow).
12. Apply Vacuum: Start the vacuum pump to begin filtration. During filtration make sure the pressure is sustained and no clogs occur. (Use hand pump as backup)
13. Disengage vacuum pump when adding more volume. Note the volume of water added and volume filtered.
#### Filter Membrane Removal
14. Decontaminate forceps by soaking in 50% bleach solution for at least 1 minute and then in deionized or distilled water, each stored in a 50 mL tube. Replace water frequently to ensure that forceps are free of bleach before touching the filter. After decontamination, the tips of the forceps should not come into contact with anything other than the filter or clean gloves.
15. Retrieve Filter Membrane: Now carefully remove the filter membrane from the funnel:
    - Unscrew or unclamp the filter holder. Avoid touching the top surface of the filter or inside of the funnel with fingers.
    - Using sterile forceps, gently lift the edge of the membrane.
    - Fold the membrane in half (biofilm side inwards), then in half again to quarter it. (If the filter is fragile or overloaded, you can skip     folding and transfer it flat, but folding helps it fit into the vial)
    - Prepare a 25mL tube and place the folded filter into the tube. Add approximately 5mL of water from the Whirl-pak into the 25mL tube.
16. Gently shake the 25mL tube to homogenize the filter with the water in the 25mL tube.
17. Place on blue ice or in the fridge until processing.
#### Cleanup for Next Sample:
18. Sanitize the filter holder for reuse.
19. Soak funnel parts in 10% bleach for ≥1 minute and rinse thoroughly with sterile water.
20. Empty and rinse the vacuum flask if it contains filtrate. Rinse or replace tubing.
21. Decontaminate forceps again (bleach then rinse) or use a fresh pair for the next sample.
22. Change gloves before proceeding to the next sample.
23. Allow to air dry for 5 min before use again to ensure bleach is fully removed.

### Coral
####  Initial Handling
1. Remove coral from ice or fridge.
2. Check if a CID is assigned to the sample.
3. Using sterile forceps, transfer the coral fragment to a mortar.
4. Add 1.0mL of the original seawater from the Whirl-pak with a P1000 pipette, transfer pipette or pour from the Whirl-pak aseptically.
#### Preparation
5. Using the pestle, apply firm, sharp downward pressure to crack the coral skeleton.
6. Continue applying pressure to break the coral into smaller fragments (5–10 mm), exposing internal tissue—but do not grind into a powder.
    - Avoid excessive shearing that could damage microbial or DNA content.
7. Using a wide-bore pipette, add 1.0 mL of the original seawater from the sample bag/tube into the mortar.
8. Gently pipette up and down to create a homogenized suspension of coral tissue, microbes, and seawater.
    - Aim for a thick slurry rather than a liquid solution.
9. Transfer the homogenized coral from the mortar into the Whirl-pak and seal the sample bag.
10. Avoid over diluting the sample, aim for ~15mL of liquid.
11. Check if the seal on the sample is secure.
12. Invert for 30 seconds to homogenize the sample.
13. Return the sample to 4C or on ice.

### Plants
#### Initial Handling
1. Remove samples from blue ice or fridge.
2. Check if a CID is assigned to the sample.
3. Using sterile forceps, transfer the plant material to a mortar.
4. Add up to ~15mL (usually ~7.5ml) of diH2O (or the original water from the Whirl-pak for aquatic plants)
#### Preparation
5. Using the pestle, apply firm, sharp downward pressure and grinding until material is as homogenized as possible.
6. Bring the volume up to up to ~15mL using diH2O or original seawater from the sample bag/tube.
    - Avoid over diluting the sample, aim for ~15mL of liquid.
7. Mix in the mortar.
8. Transfer the homogenized coral from the mortar back into the Whirl-pak (field) or 50ml tube (lab) and seal.
9. Check if the seal on the sample is secure.
10. Invert for 30 seconds to homogenize the sample.
11. Return the sample to 4C or on blue ice.

## Sample Preservation
Proper preservation ensures the integrity of microbial communities for downstream molecular and culturing analyses. Follow the protocols below for DNA/RNA stabilization and cryogenic stock preparation for each of the sample types described above. Please see preparing preservation buffers prior to proceeding with sample preservation.

#### DNA/RNA Shield Aliquot:
1. Homogenize the sample by shaking Whirl-pak (or tube) vigorously for 15 seconds.
2. Use a P1000 pipette and wide-bore tip to add 1.5 mL of homogenized sample to a 5.0 mL tube containing 1.5 mL of DNA/RNA Shield.
    - Collect up to 2 replicates.
3. Cap tightly, invert vigorously seconds to mix.
4. Store at room temperature or 4°C, then transfer to long-term storage at -20°C.

#### Cryogenic Stocks (DMSO & Glycerol):
1. Homogenize the sample by shaking Whirl-pak vigorously for 15 seconds.
2. Use a P1000 pipette and wide-bore tip to add 0.75 mL of homogenized sample into cryovials pre-loaded with:
  - 0.75 mL of DMSO
      - Collect up to 3 replicates.
  - 0.75 mL of Glycerol
      -  Collect up to 3 replicates.
3. Invert each tube 5 times to mix. Tap gently to ensure liquid is at the bottom of the tube before freezing.
4. Immediately place on dry ice, then store at -80°C.

#### Original Sample Stock
1. Homogenize the sample by shaking Whirl-pak vigorously for 15 seconds.
2. Use a P1000 pipette and wide-bore tip to add 1.5 mL of homogenized sample into cryovials without ANY cryopreservant:
    - No additive cryovials
      - Collect at least 1
3. Immediately place on wet ice, store and transport at 4°C.

### Controls
1. Collect 1 batch control from the DNA/RNA shield and cryogenic stocks (DMSO & Glycerol) to serve as a control for transport and field contamination.
    - Without banking, run these tubes through every step you would normally run a sample. For example, for a coral negative control, take sterile water, invert it, place it in a pestle, run a mortar through it, etc.
    - Never skip negative controls, these will be absolutely critical for bioinformatic decontamination downstream.
2. Assign each of these the sample CID.
