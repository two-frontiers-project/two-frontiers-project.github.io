# Sample Transportation

### Background
The transportation of biological and environmental samples is a critical link in the chain of custody between field collection and laboratory processing. Improper handling during transit can compromise sample integrity, lead to contamination, or result in the loss of valuable data. This protocol ensures that all 2FP samples—regardless of preservation method or destination—are transported under conditions that preserve microbial, chemical, and physical integrity for downstream applications such as sequencing, culturing, or chemical analysis.

It applies to all transport methods, including hand-carry, domestic shipping, and international export. The focus is on preservative-specific temperature requirements, redundant containment to prevent leakage, and the inclusion of proper documentation for customs and regulatory clearance.
All personnel transporting samples must be trained in sample-specific handling, aware of biosafety and import/export regulations, and prepared to respond to delays, temperature excursions, or other transport-related issues. Samples must be tracked from departure to receipt, with any deviations documented immediately.

## Protocols

### General Guidelines
All samples must be clearly labeled with their CID and preservative type before leaving the field lab. A printed and digital manifest should accompany the shipment, listing each sample ID, its contents, and its destination. Secondary containment—such as sealed bags or boxes lined with absorbent material—is required for most shipments, especially those crossing national borders. Double bagging with absorbent material inside the inner bag is standard practice.

Each shipment must include official documentation: a cover letter on organizational letterhead describing the samples, any required Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs), and all relevant permits. Waterproof contact information should be affixed to both the primary and secondary containers. Even when not legally required, we recommend declaring samples at customs to avoid seizure.

When shipping with dry ice, use only carriers certified to handle “dangerous goods” and never seal dry ice in an airtight container. If driving or traveling with dry ice, ensure proper ventilation, use a CO₂ monitor, and avoid sealed compartments. Always include a temperature logger placed near the samples, and use trackers such as AirTags to monitor location during transit.

### Packing Checklist:
1. Printed and digital manifest.
2. Samples double bagged with absorbent material inside inner bag.
3. Waterproof labels with CID, preservative, and contact details.
4. Official letter, MTAs, and permits in shipment.
5. Temperature logger and shipment tracker.
6. Verified carrier compliance for dry ice or dangerous goods.

### Temperature Requirements

#### Room Temperature Samples (e.g., DNA/RNA Shield):
Samples preserved at room temperature should be transported in insulated containers or padded boxes. Double bagging with absorbent material is required for most international shipments. Avoid prolonged exposure to heat or direct sunlight; use blue ice when ambient temperatures exceed 21 °C. If using data loggers, set them to record every 5–10 minutes, and limit exposure to ambient air during transfers between storage and transport containers.

#### Frozen Samples (e.g., DMSO/glycerol cryovials):
Ship on dry ice for short-term transport. If dry ice is not available in the field, keep on blue/wet ice or at 4C until samples can be frozen down further. Do not allow samples’ temperatures to rise past the minimum temperature you have preserved them at beforehand for any extended period of time (e.g., do not transfer from 4C to room temp or -80 to 4C). Double bag the samples with an absorbent material in the inner bag (required for most international transit) and clearly label the contents. Ensure sufficient dry ice is packed for the full transport duration (typically ≥5 kg per day).

### Documentation & Compliance
The movement of biological and environmental samples across state or national borders is regulated to protect agriculture, public health, and biodiversity. Many environmental sample types require specific permits, and requirements vary depending on the origin, destination, and intended use of the material. It is the responsibility of the transporting party to verify and comply with all applicable rules before departure. Failure to comply can result in confiscation, destruction, or legal penalties, and may jeopardize future research access.

### Permit requirements by sample type:
1. **Soils** — Transporting soil, particularly agricultural soil, often requires permits from agencies such as the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in the United States. International imports/exports may require phytosanitary certificates, even for small volumes. Some countries prohibit soil import entirely without sterilization or fumigation. When in doubt, request a formal determination from the relevant authority before travel.

2. **Marine sediment/seawater** — Typically exempt from permitting if free from large invertebrates and clearly designated as research samples. However, certain countries treat all marine sediments as regulated materials if collected within marine protected areas. Confirm local collection and export rules, especially for sediment containing visible fauna or collected from culturally or ecologically sensitive sites.

3. **Corals** — All stony corals, whether alive, dead, or in fragment form, are regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Even small pieces or skeletons often require both export and import CITES permits. This applies regardless of whether the coral is preserved in ethanol, dried, or fixed in resin. Allow for extended permitting timelines (often several months).

4. **Other sensitive materials** — Samples containing plant matter, freshwater organisms, endangered species, or microbiological cultures may trigger additional regulations. This includes the Nagoya Protocol in countries with access and benefit-sharing frameworks.

**Descriptive cover letter requirements:**
 Every shipment—whether hand-carried or couriered—must include a descriptive letter on official organizational letterhead that:
1. Lists sample types, quantities (e.g., mL or g), and preservation methods (e.g., ethanol, DNA/RNA Shield, glycerol).
2. States explicitly that samples are non-pathogenic, non-living, and non-host origin.
3. Explains the intended use (e.g., “for scientific research only, with no commercial value”).
4. Confirms that packaging meets IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations and airline/courier guidelines for leak-proof, insulated, and labeled transport.
5. Includes full sender and recipient contact information.
6. References any relevant permits, MTAs, or collaborating institutions.

*Below is an example letter **declaring samples that do not require additional permitting/clearance** describing the work. This is modeled after a letter we use when flying internationally with samples. Note that we indicate the non-host, non-pathogenic nature of the samples.*

“I am writing on behalf of The Two Frontiers Project (a 501(c)(3) non-profit research organization) to declare the contents of a research sample shipment being transported by hand from XXX to the United States. The shipment consists of non-hazardous, non-living environmental research samples, approximately 200 mL of seawater and 112.5 grams of marine sediment collected from the XXX. These samples do not contain any animal or human material, are not infectious, and are being imported for scientific research purposes only. They are stored in a deactivating solution, on ice.

The samples are being hand-carried on a commercial flight from XXX to XXX under a valid Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) between the University of Palermo and The Two Frontiers Project. A copy of the MTA and all relevant supporting documents is attached for your reference. The research involves the hand collection of surface marine sediment by SCUBA diving, in sterile containers, and sterile collection of seawater. No commercial value is attached to these samples.

Regulatory Compliance: We affirm that these materials are non-pathogenic and pose no known risk to agriculture or public health. The marine water and sediment have been screened to ensure they contain no visible invasive organisms. We are not transporting any organisms derived from soil or from agriculture.The samples are packaged according to IATA and airline regulations: they are sealed in leak-proof containers and packed on gel ice/blue ice in an insulated cooler to preserve low temperature. Secondary samples are kept at room temperature.”

### Best practices for documentation:
  - Carry at least two spare printed copies of all permits and cover letters in separate locations (e.g., one with the shipment, one with the traveler, and one stored in cloud storage).
  - Keep digital copies of all documentation accessible offline on a mobile device or USB drive.
  - If a shipment passes through multiple carriers or customs points, label each container with a “Documentation Inside” note in waterproof ink.
  - Where possible, secure permits that cover multiple shipments or multiple sample types to reduce administrative burden.
  - For international shipments, confirm if the country of transit (not just origin/destination) has any biological material restrictions.

### Proactive compliance measures:
  - Initiate permitting processes early—CITES and APHIS approvals can take months.
  -  Maintain a master log of permits, expiration dates, and conditions of use for expeditions.
  - When working with international collaborators, determine if permits must be obtained by both the sending and receiving institutions.
  - Keep a copy of the expedition’s Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) in the shipment and in the traveler’s carry-on.

### Emergency
  - Include contact information on the outside of the package in case of shipping delay or damage to the box/container.
  - Store replicates separately, so if there are issues, backups may be available.
  - Include a brief SOP or quick-reference sheet with emergency procedures in case of customs seizure, temperature excursion, or container rupture.
  - Provide an emergency contact number with 24/7 coverage (e.g., field coordinator or lab PI) on both the exterior and interior of the cooler.
  - Carry additional blank customs declaration letters and copies of permits in case originals are lost or damaged.
