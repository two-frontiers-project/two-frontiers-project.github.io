# Post-Sample Collection Reset and Team Debrief

## Background
The conclusion of a Two Frontiers Project (2FP) sampling event marks a critical transition—from field operations to laboratory processing, data integration, and scientific analysis. Just as rigorous planning precedes deployment, structured debriefing and systematic equipment reset are essential to close the operational loop. These procedures ensure consumables are tracked, equipment is maintained, and lessons are documented for future expeditions.

Among these steps, the formal team debrief is especially important. It is often the only dedicated time for participants to collectively reflect, synthesize observations, and capture lessons while they are fresh. Expeditions are high-tempo and resource-constrained, and without a deliberate process, failures, workarounds, and best practices can be lost to memory or siloed with individuals. A structured debrief transforms those experiences into shared institutional knowledge, feeding directly into checklists, workflows, and protocols.

*Debriefs also have a cultural function:* they validate the intense labor of fieldwork, acknowledge challenges faced, and reinforce communication norms within the team. Without them, mistakes recur, resources are wasted, and progress slows.

## Protocols

### Equipment Reset and Consumable Replenishment

After every expedition, all field and laboratory gear should be cleaned, decontaminated, dried, and repacked according to the master inventory list. Any broken, missing, or malfunctioning items must be recorded in the equipment damage/loss tracker.

Consumables—including cryovials, Whirl-Paks, labels, ethanol, PPE, and reagents—must be restocked or added to an immediate purchase order. A full usage log for all major equipment and consumables should be completed to:
  - Identify overstocked items to reduce packing volume next time.
  - Flag understocked or quickly consumed items to avoid shortages.
  - Improve future budget accuracy based on real usage.

The sample manifest and cold chain logs must be finalized and archived. Data from all loggers, temperature sensors, and GPS devices should be downloaded, synced, and stored securely.
The expedition lead should circulate a post-expedition email summarizing:
  - Sample status and storage location.
  - Any logistical notes relevant for follow-up.
  - Next steps for sample processing, analysis, and reporting.
  - Acknowledgments for team contributions and outstanding needs.

### Mandatory Team Debrief
- A formal debrief must be held at the conclusion of every major sampling event.
- Attendance is mandatory for all expedition participants, regardless of role.
- The debrief should be scheduled for no later than two weeks after the final sampling operation, ideally before full team dispersal.
- The Debrief Form must be filled out **continuously during the expedition**. All team members must have access so they can add comments to it real-time. It is a living document that captures:
    - Equipment failures or successes.
    - Logistical challenges (e.g., customs issues, transport delays, housing failures).
    - Site-specific access considerations.
    - Personnel and communication breakdowns or improvements.
- The form we use is the one pictured below and linked in the Resources section:
    - Each row represents an incident or lesson learned.
    - The status is marked as “Pending,” “Resolved,” “Unresolved,” or “No longer relevant.”
    - Each entry must include a description, the person who entered it, the date, and any comments or suggested solutions.
- During the debrief meeting, the team must:
    - Go through each row in the Debrief Form.
    - Confirm status updates in real time.
    - Discuss any unresolved issues as a group.
    - Assign follow-up actions where needed.
- The final version of the Debrief Form must be:
    - Archived in the expedition records.
    - Reviewed during planning for subsequent expeditions.
    - Used to refine checklists, workflows, and training materials.
- This is not a bureaucratic exercise. The debrief process is mission-critical for avoiding repeat failures and evolving our standards.
- If it’s not written down and reviewed, it will be forgotten.
- Lessons learned are not “nice to have”—they are the foundation of **safer, leaner, and more effective expeditions.**

### Maintaining gear and decontamination
All equipment used in the field must undergo full cleaning and decontamination according to standard protocols before being returned to storage or redeployed. Follow relevant regulatory and environmental guidelines, such as the **EPA Field Equipment Decontamination Procedures.**
