# About the 2FP Field Handbook
This handbook is the official Field Sampling and Processing Guide of The Two Frontiers Project (2FP). It has been developed to provide standardized, modular, and field-operational protocols for environmental microbial sampling across terrestrial and aquatic systems, including SCUBA-based marine work.

### Intended Audience
This handbook is designed for:
- **Field researchers** (microbiologists, ecologists, biogeochemists)
- **Expedition participants** (including student trainees and local collaborators)
- **Laboratory technicians** and researchers
- **Partner institutions** and regulatory reviewers

Whether you are a first-time field assistant or an experienced expedition leader, this guide is intended to ensure methodological consistency, safe operations, and scientific integrity across all projects bearing the 2FP name.

### Format
This document is structured into discrete modules, corresponding to stages of the sampling lifecycle:
- **Planning:** logistics, permits, team roles, buffer prep
- **Collection:** sample-type-specific protocols (water, sediment, biomass, host)
- **Processing:** homogenization, labeling, and preservation
- **Transportation:** maintaining cold chain and documentation
- **Post-field:** reset procedures and metadata archiving

### Each module includes:
- Background context
- Step-by-step protocols
- Summary
- Notes on hazards, errors, and contingencies

### Field Use
While this is the full reference guide, you should also carry the field-ready 2FP Sampling Slate or Laminated Quick-Protocol Cards, which summarize critical steps for each sample type. These can be customized for each expedition and sampling style (e.g., SCUBA slates, backpack-ready terrestrial kits).

**Use this handbook:**
- **Before the field:** for training, kit assembly, and team planning
- **During the expedition:** for verification of sampling techniques and troubleshooting
- **After the field:** for processing, preservation, shipping, and sample intake

If in doubt in the field: go back to the 2FP Field Slates or this Handbook. Follow the steps. Prioritize sterility, traceability, and safety.

## General Guidelines
These guidelines underpin every step of The Two Frontiers Project’s field and laboratory workflows. They are not sample-type-specific — whether sampling coral tissue at 20m depth or collecting soil in a high-altitude desert, these standards apply.

#### 1. Sterility and Contamination Control
*Protecting sample purity is essential for generating high-quality, reproducible data. Contamination at any stage — field or lab — can compromise results and waste valuable effort.*
- Wear gloves at all times when handling any collection materials or biological samples. Change gloves frequently, especially between sites or sample types.
- Use pre-sterilized, single-use collection bags and tools whenever possible. If reusable tools are used, disinfect with 70–80% ethanol or flame-sterilize between uses.
- Never touch the interior of sample bags or caps of cryovials. Avoid breathing directly over open sample containers.
- Prepare buffers, aliquot, and process samples only in designated clean areas. Decontaminate work surfaces with 10% bleach followed by 70% ethanol. Let the bleach sit for 5-10 minutes before wiping. Let air dry before applying 70% ethanol.

#### 2. Sample Integrity
*Preserving the original biological and chemical state of a sample ensures it reflects the environment it came from, and ensures it can be used for downstream analysis.*
- Use new collection bags and cryovials for every sample. Do not reuse Whirl-Paks or cryovials, even within the same site.
- Place samples into the appropriate preservative immediately after collection to prevent microbial community drift.
- Keep all samples upright, on ice, and protected from direct sunlight until further processing.
- Label clearly and redundantly, including: Field ID, unique sample ID (ideally generated using CUAL-ID), sample type, date, and collector initials.

#### 3. Traceability and Metadata
*Complete and accurate records make each sample scientifically valuable, enabling re-analysis, replication, and sharing within and beyond 2FP.*
- Assign every sample a unique 2FP CID (Collection ID) that is traceable from field collection through to final storage.
- Record metadata at the time of collection, including: date, time, GPS coordinates (decimal degrees), collector initials, and environmental observations.
- Upload supporting materials (e.g., field photos, dive logs, handwritten notes) to the designated expedition cloud drive within 48 hours.

#### 4. Team Safety and Role Clarity
*Our safety protocols protect both people and science — a safe, well-coordinated team is essential for successful and sustainable expeditions.*
- Never collect samples alone. Field teams should operate in pairs or trios with clearly assigned roles.
- For SCUBA operations, assign explicit dive tasks during the pre-dive briefing and review underwater communication signals.
- Conduct a safety briefing before each field day to review site-specific hazards, emergency protocols, and contact information.

#### 5. Redundancy and Replication
*Building in backups reduces the risk of data loss and maximizes the scientific return from every field effort.*
- Where possible, collect at least two replicates per condition/sample type.
- Preserve replicates in multiple preservative types (e.g., glycerol for culturing, DNA/RNA Shield for sequencing).
- Maintain backup storage locations for key samples to safeguard against loss or spoilage.

#### 6. Ethical Bioprospecting: Respect for Local Ecosystems and Partners
*2FP’s work is built on respect — for ecosystems, local communities, and shared global biodiversity. We follow not just legal requirements but ethical best practices.*
- Minimize habitat disturbance and avoid sampling in protected or sacred sites without permission.
- Follow all permit and export requirements — when in doubt, assume permits are needed.
- Acknowledge the contribution of local collaborators, communities, and biodiversity stewards.
- Communicate fully to land owners and local partners the nature of your intent with a given sample taken on their land (e.g., research vs. commercial use).
