## Introduction: 
This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) has been outlined to cover the sampling and processing of general environmental samples for the study of microorganisms.

### Scope: 
The purpose of this protocol is to collect samples for downstream metagenomic sequencing and microbial culturing. It is applicable but not limited to sediment, soil, water, biomass, and coral. The methodologies discussed here are applicable to both terrestrial environments (i.e. mountains, land, desert) and bodies of water (i.e. lakes, rivers, oceans). This applies to both flowing and standing water. However, some modifications to the protocol will be made based on the location. For the purpose of this procedure, the above is defined as such:

**Sediment:** deposit of insoluble material, primarily rock and soil particles, transported from land areas to bodies of water.

**Soil:** The upper layer of earth in which plants grow, a black or dark brown material typically consisting of a mixture of organic remains, clay, and rock particles.

**Water:** Water that has accumulated on the earth's surface, located on top of land or below land (i.e. groundwater).

**Biomass:** Biomass is a multi-layered, cohesive community of microorganisms, primarily bacteria and archaea, that grow on surfaces in various environments. These mats are often structured in layers, with different microbial groups occupying distinct strata based on their metabolic functions and environmental conditions. For this context, we use this term interchangeably with microbial mat or biofilm.

**Host samples:**
- **Coral:** marine invertebrate living mainly in ocean environments.
- **Plants:** Includes plant biomass (above or below ground) and soil containing roots
- **Invertebrates:** Occasional organisms, often marine benthic
