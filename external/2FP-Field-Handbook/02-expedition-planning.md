# Expedition Planning

## Background
Expedition planning is the foundation of every successful Two Frontiers Project sampling effort. A well-planned expedition maximizes scientific yield, minimizes environmental impact, and ensures team safety. These steps are not optional — they are the baseline for maintaining our reputation for excellence, integrity, and collaboration.

Sampling under extreme or remote conditions requires not just technical readiness, but a cohesive, role-oriented team, an ethically chosen site, and an understanding of cultural and logistical context. No matter the destination—deep-sea reef, arid soil, or coastal lagoon—each site demands its own level of preparation, precaution, and partnership.

This section outlines how to assemble an expedition team, choose your collection site, ethically engage local collaborators, and set appropriate planning timelines. These are not just organizational steps; they are an essential part of scientific stewardship.

## Protocols

### Selecting a site
Site selection depends on scientific value, accessibility, regulatory constraints, operational feasibility, and a thorough risk assessment. This risk review should address environmental hazards (storms, wildlife, toxic gases), political or security risks, and health considerations (altitude, remoteness from medical care). Teams must also check seasonality to confirm conditions will be workable during the planned window (e.g., avoiding monsoon season, hurricanes, high-temperatures or ice cover). 

Pre-site reconnaissance using satellite imagery and mapping tools is strongly encouraged. Ideal sites are novel or under-characterized microbial environments, especially where geochemical or ecological gradients suggest stratified or metabolically diverse communities. Examples include shallow methane seeps, acidified coastal zones, hypersaline ponds, hydrothermal-influenced sediments, or coral–algal transition zones.

##### Teams must also evaluate:
- Physical access: factoring in terrain, transportation requirements, and travel time.
- Environmental conditions: such as weather patterns, sea state, depth limits, or exposure levels.
- Alignment with team capabilities: ensuring activities (e.g., SCUBA diving, mountaineering) remain within the most conservative skill and safety limits of any team member.
  
Backup sites should be identified in case primary locations become inaccessible. Cold chain, storage and preservation workflows must be feasible for any selected site—if they cannot be maintained, the site should not be used.

### Assembling a team and assigning roles
Each expedition team should be constructed with overlapping competencies, complementary personalities, and redundant technical skills. Every high-risk expedition should include at least one member with advanced field medical capacity (e.g., Wilderness First Aid or Diver Rescue certification). All members should receive cross-training in critical contingency tasks like cold chain repair, metadata entry, and buffer preparation, even if outside their primary role. A pre-departure communications plan must be established, assigning responsibility for satellite phone, radio protocols, and daily check-ins if operating in remote or high-risk zones. Success in the field requires more than subject-matter expertise—it requires a team capable of navigating uncertainty, adapting to variable field conditions, and operating effectively in isolated or high-stress environments.

Team members must collectively cover the following domains: scientific expertise relevant to the study objectives (e.g., microbiology, environmental chemistry), prior field experience in the terrain being sampled (such as underwater, alpine, or desert systems), leadership and decision-making capacity, and the ability to function effectively within a small, diverse team in unfamiliar environments. We also prioritize traits like tolerance for discomfort, a demonstrated capacity to manage ambiguity, and the ability to maintain productivity despite possible fatigue, logistical failure, or physical stress.
To avoid single points of failure, at least two team members must be trained in each core technical task: [sample collection](06-sample-collection.md) (e.g., diving, sediment core extraction),[sample preservation](08-sample-processing-and-preservation.md) (e.g., cryovial handling, buffer use, cold chain protocols), and [sample check-in](07-sample-check-in.md) (e.g., CID assignment, GPS logging, photograph management). This ensures the expedition can proceed even in the event of illness, injury, or gear failure.

All team members should be briefed on their primary and secondary roles in advance of departure. Clear role assignment avoids ambiguity and duplication during collection. Prior to fieldwork, teams should review key safety plans, sample handling protocols, emergency procedures, and data management expectations. The highest-functioning teams are those who are cross-trained, aligned on objectives, and able to rotate tasks when needed.

### Ethics
All sampling must be conducted in accordance with 2FP’s ethical framework, the Nagoya Protocol (where applicable), and all local regulations. Sites that fall within protected areas, sacred spaces, or community-managed ecosystems should not be sampled without explicit, documented permission. This includes marine parks, indigenous territories, archaeological sites, and other culturally or ecologically sensitive zones. In cases of uncertainty, sampling should be paused until clearance is obtained.

Teams must also evaluate the potential ecological impact of collection. If sample extraction would lead to irreversible damage to a habitat, such as destabilizing a microbial mat or breaking apart a fragile coral assemblage, an alternative sample site should be selected. In all cases, habitat disturbance should be minimized, and photographic documentation should accompany the sample to contextualize its removal. Teams must incorporate biosecurity measures to prevent cross-site contamination or the spread of invasive species, including cleaning and disinfecting gear between sampling sites. Benefit-sharing should be considered even for research-only samples, ensuring data or results are returned to local partners.

Fieldwork is not extractive research. It must be executed with transparency, humility, and respect for local communities, researchers, and stewards of the environments being studied.

### Finding local collaborators
Local collaborators are essential for accessing field sites legally, working safely, and collecting ethically. In many cases, securing a collaborator is also a requirement for permitting, export, or sample use. Collaborators may be based at universities, government agencies, NGOs, field stations, or private land holdings. The goal is to identify someone who is familiar with the sampling region, understands its ecological or regulatory context, and can provide guidance or assistance with access, safety, or approvals.

**Below are recommended approaches for identifying and establishing contact with potential local collaborators:**
1. Search the academic literature for publications involving your site or region of interest. Use Google Scholar, Web of Science, or Scopus to search for terms like the name of the lake, reef, or reserve, plus keywords like “microbial,” “sediment,” “sampling,” or “biodiversity.” Prioritize authors listed with local affiliations. Email the corresponding author directly and clearly describe your sampling plans and collaboration request.

2. Look for nearby universities or research institutes, even if they haven’t published on your specific site. Departments in marine biology, environmental science, geology, or agriculture are good starting points. Many institutions have field stations, labs, or graduate students who are actively sampling nearby. Department websites and institutional directories can help you identify staff or faculty contacts.

3. Reach out to private landowners directly if your sampling site is on private property. Use Google Maps or cadastral databases to identify ownership. Local government or town offices may be able to provide contact information. When reaching out, be clear about what the work involves, how long you’ll be there, and whether you’re requesting access, samples, or assistance. Offer to share your results and be respectful of their land use or concerns.

4. Contact dive shops, boat operators, or environmental NGOs that work in the region. These groups often have intimate knowledge of local conditions and may have assisted previous research efforts. If sampling underwater, dive operators may be able to provide both logistical support and introductions to scientific contacts.

5. Use permitting or export authorities as a point of contact. In some countries, agencies that oversee scientific permits will have approved collaborator lists or may connect you to institutions with existing sample access agreements.Leverage existing 2FP or collaborator networks.
6. Contact a 2FP program lead if you're working in a region where we or our partners have operated in the past. Prior collaborators may be willing to assist again or can recommend others.

Whenever possible, formalize collaboration through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or written collaboration agreement to prevent misunderstandings. Consider tapping into citizen science and conservation networks for local expertise. Once you identify a prospective collaborator, send a direct, concise inquiry. Introduce yourself, outline your project aims, state your anticipated field dates and locations, and describe what kind of collaboration you're seeking (e.g., letters of support, permitting, joint sampling, site access, equipment sharing). Always offer co-authorship or material/data sharing when appropriate. Be clear about what you are offering in return and never assume unpaid labor.

We recommend identifying potential collaborators at least 12 weeks out from sampling, if not more. Some permits can take up to a year to grant, so in many cases this may be far too conservative an estimate.

### Permitting
Permitting is a fundamental part of expedition planning. Whether collecting from private land, public land, or international territories, failing to secure the right permissions or misrepresenting the intended use of samples can invalidate entire research programs and lead to reputational, financial, or even legal consequences. This is particularly true when it comes to commercial use designation.

Samples must be explicitly declared for commercial use at the time of collection if there is any possibility they will be used in downstream industrial, biotech, or product development applications. This is not just a legal distinction—it is an ethical one. Declaring “research only” and then pivoting to commercial exploitation violates trust, breaches permits, and can jeopardize future access for all. Always consult with permitting authorities, landowners, and legal counsel before sample acquisition.

#### Private lands
Building access to private land is primarily a relationship-building exercise, requiring cultural sensitivity, especially when working with indigenous territories or areas with customary ownership rules. All verbal agreements should be documented in writing promptly after meetings. Scientific merit matters but so does trust. Cold outreach often works best through local universities, conservation groups, or citizen science networks. When landowners are engaged, 2FP offers a simple, plain-language release form that clearly states what we are collecting, how samples will be used, and who retains ownership. Importantly, we allow landowners to redline this form on-site—modifying terms or restricting use as they see fit. This transparency builds credibility and usually leads to more successful collaborations.
Identifying lands of interest can be done using public data sources. For example, the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) can help locate high-CO₂ springs or unusual water chemistry sites. Property ownership databases, county GIS maps, and water rights records can all help pinpoint access routes and decision-makers.
Public lands

Public lands are governed by a patchwork of agencies—each with its own permitting rules, timelines, and expectations. In the U.S., the key distinction is whether land is federal, state, or municipal, but even within these categories, jurisdiction can vary.
For U.S. federal lands, including Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Forest Service, and National Parks:

- Bureau of Land Management lands are often permissive. Incidental use provisions allow small-scale, non-invasive sampling—such as a few milliliters of water or grams of soil—to be conducted with only a short letter of notification or a simple form.
- National Parks are among the most restrictive, particularly regarding anything with potential commercial use. Even academic research often requires a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), which can take months and may limit data sharing or IP ownership.
- Partnering with an institution or PI that already holds a permit is often the fastest path to access.
For state lands, rules vary widely. Some states allow low-volume environmental sampling under educational exemptions or require only agency notification. Others demand formal scientific collection permits, often with conservation reviews or public comment periods. Always check state natural resource department websites, and start the process early—permits can take weeks to months.

In all cases, the best strategy is early outreach, clear communication of intended use (research vs. commercial), and documentation of all correspondence. Permitting should be treated as a gating item in project timelines.
