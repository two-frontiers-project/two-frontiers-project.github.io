# Preparation for Sample Collection

## Background
Preparation is where 2FP’s field success is decided. Every expedition begins with clear planning, structured workflows, and built-in redundancy for all critical operations. Regardless of environment — desert, reef, forest, or vent field — the same core principles apply: samples must be traceable, sterile, biologically representative, and compatible with downstream sequencing and culturing.

**This section outlines how to:**
- Define a sampling plan aligned with objectives and constraints
- Build and check your kit
- Prepare for safety contingencies
- Ensure metadata and cold chain coverage from the start

### Defining sampling plans
Every expedition requires a clear sampling strategy that aligns with scientific goals, site constraints, and team capacity. A strong plan defines what types of samples will be collected, how many replicates are needed per site, which preservation methods will be used, and who is responsible for each step.

Sampling goals should be defined prior to departure. Specify whether the objective is metagenomic sequencing, microbial cultivation, geochemical correlation, or all of the above. Match sample types to research questions (e.g., if you are interested in complex communities, emphasize biomass, if you are interested in free-living organisms, emphasize water sampling). Ensure that sample sizes will guarantee statistical power to enable your downstream collection plans. Plan for depth of and type of sequencing for each given sample, and plan for downstream culturing activities. If no culturing is needed, certain cryopreservatives may not be required (or, for example, if phototrophs are not of interest, DMSO may not be needed). Similarly, if DNA sequencing is not needed, samples do not need to be preserved in a DNA shield.

##### During Sample Collection Planning, teams must define:
- Number of sites
- Number and type of samples per site
- Collection methods
- Preservation strategy per sample
- Which team members are responsible for collection, labeling, metadata, and preservation

Develop a field sheet or digital form to track this in real time. Do not improvise sample types in the field without confirming whether they are permitted, logistically supported, or scientifically justified.

#### Terrestrial Collection
Terrestrial sampling can include water from springs, rivers, and seeps, sediment, microbial mats, soil, and plant material. Site access may require hiking, climbing, or navigating through remote terrain, and often requires landowner or government approvals. Planning for terrestrial sampling must account for terrain and elevation changes, environmental conditions such as dust or dryness that can increase contamination risk, and the distance from base camp or laboratory, which directly impacts cold chain management.
Teams should also anticipate the need for alternate water sources for rinsing or mixing, and prepare for hazards such as extreme temperatures, high altitude, or wildlife encounters. Sampling in these environments demands careful consideration of physical access routes, weight and portability of equipment, and the ability to transport samples quickly back to refrigeration or preservation stations.

#### Underwater Collection
Underwater sampling requires dive-qualified personnel, certified equipment, and strict adherence to local diving and sampling laws. Samples may include water, sediment, microbial mats, coral, or invertebrate surfaces. The logistical complexity of underwater work demands highly detailed dive plans, which must specify maximum and target depths for each site, the number of dives per day per diver, and post-dive no-fly times.
Roles and tasks should be clearly assigned during pre-dive briefings and reinforced through agreed underwater communication methods. Dive computers must be synced prior to sampling to ensure accurate metadata capture. All dives should be supported by the presence of an O₂ kit on board and a plan for accessing the nearest hyperbaric chamber. 2FP recommends that all divers carry DAN dive insurance. Dive plans should be reviewed daily, and all sampling gear, such as pre-assembled slates and mesh bags, should be prepared in advance to maximize underwater efficiency.

**Underwater plans must include:**
- Maximum and target depth for each site
- Number of dives per day per diver and proximity to flying
- Sample types to be collected per dive
- Clear leadership and task structure when diving, as well as sample-specific visual communication methods
- Adherence to all standard diving protocols (e.g., having an O2 kit on board, knowing the location of the nearest hyperbaric chamber)
- We recommend diving with [DAN dive insurance](https://dan.org/membership-insurance/dive-insurance/).

*As with terrestrial sampling, sampling slates and mesh bags should be pre-assembled for each dive. Dive computers must be synced before collection to aid metadata matching. Dive plans should be submitted and reviewed daily.*

### Safety preparedness and briefing
Safety is a core pillar of every expedition. Before departure, one team member must be appointed as the Safety Officer, serving as the central resource for all safety-related information during field operations. This individual is responsible for knowing and communicating the locations of first aid kits, nearest hospitals or clinics, emergency muster points, local hazards (including wildlife), and any other relevant safety resources. While it is ideal for the Safety Officer to be a trained first responder or medical professional, this is not a requirement; the key is that this person is proactive, detail-oriented, and able to access and relay information quickly. Any questions about safety protocols in the field should be directed to the Safety Officer.
In addition to appointing this role, a safety briefing must be delivered before sampling begins. This briefing should cover general hazards, site-specific risks, and the protocols in place to address them. It may be led entirely by the Safety Officer or shared among team members with relevant expertise — for example, dive instructors may lead the diving safety component, while local collaborators may present on environmental hazards unique to the site. The goal is to ensure that every member of the team understands the risks, mitigation strategies, and emergency procedures before work starts.

### Dive safety
All underwater work conducted by 2FP follows the standards of the [American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS)](https://www.aaus.org/). This includes comprehensive dive planning, pre-dive briefings, and adherence to operational limits based on diver training and experience. An O₂ kit must be present on the dive vessel, and the location of the nearest hyperbaric chamber must be confirmed before the first dive. Dive plans must also account for post-dive no-fly intervals and the physical limits of the least-experienced diver on the team. 2FP is in the process of obtaining full AAUS organizational membership and will update this handbook with the complete dive manual upon approval.

#### Pre-Dive Safety Checklist

### Wilderness Safety
When operating in remote terrestrial or inland aquatic environments, additional hazards must be considered. These may include extreme weather, rapid changes in terrain, limited access to rescue services, and potential encounters with wildlife. Teams should carry sufficient emergency supplies — including extra food, water, shelter, and navigation tools — and should have a plan for evacuation in the event of injury or environmental hazards such as floods, landslides, or storms. The Safety Officer should be familiar with the local climate, terrain, and wildlife risks, and all team members should know the designated muster point and contact procedures in case of separation.

#### Wilderness Safety Checklist
- [ ] **Confirm** all team members have reviewed site-specific hazards
- [ ] **Identify** muster points and evacuation routes
- [ ] **Verify** first aid kits are stocked and accessible
- [ ] **Confirm** at least one satellite phone or radio is functional and charged
- [ ] **Ensure** emergency contact numbers are stored in multiple devices
- [ ] **Review** expected weather and potential hazards for the day
- [ ] **Verify** all members have sufficient water, food, and protective clothing
- [ ] **Check** navigation tools (GPS units, maps, compasses) are operational
- [ ] **Confirm** wildlife deterrents or precautions are in place where relevant
- [ ] **Review** plan for communication if a member becomes separated

### Other Safety Circumstances
Expeditions may encounter environments that present unique safety challenges outside of standard diving or remote terrestrial work. These conditions require specific preparation, equipment, and training.

#### Cold and Snow/Ice Regions
In cold regions — including alpine environments, polar zones, and high-latitude field sites — hazards include frostbite, hypothermia, snow blindness, and avalanche risk. Weather conditions can change rapidly, and visibility can drop to near zero. Footing may be unstable due to ice, snow bridges, or crevasses. Team members must be trained in cold-weather survival basics, avalanche awareness, and emergency shelter use.

#### Extreme Heat and Arid Regions
In hot or desert environments, risks include dehydration, heat exhaustion, and heatstroke. Sampling plans should avoid peak heat hours, and shade should be available during breaks.

#### Unstable or High-Risk Terrain
For steep slopes, scree fields, cliffs, or unstable ground, teams should move in small groups, maintain visual contact, and avoid loading unstable surfaces with excess weight. Ropes and helmets may be required.

### Selecting equipment and generating inventory list/kits
Sampling equipment must be tailored to the specific requirements of the expedition, with redundancy scaled to the remoteness and risk profile of the environment. For deployments hundreds of miles from the nearest supply point, it may be necessary to bring an entire additional Pelican case dedicated to backup equipment. For operations based in or near a city, a lighter redundancy plan may be sufficient.
As a standard practice, 2FP aims to ensure that all mission-critical objectives can be achieved in at least two different ways. For example, if a powered water filtration pump fails, a manual hand pump should be available as a backup. If pre-filled DNA/RNA Shield tubes leak, a sealed set of backup DNA/RNA Shield wrapped in parafilm should be on hand. Consumables are packed at approximately 30% above projected needs to account for scope changes (e.g., unplanned sample sites), as well as for inevitable losses or breakages (e.g., dropped Whirl-Paks).
Personal equipment should never be used for organizational work to ensure accountability, standardization, and compliance with 2FP’s quality control standards.

The **2FP INVENTORY_AND_TRANSPORT** spreadsheet should be used during planning to guide kit generation. While precise contents will vary by expedition, kits typically include:
1. Microbiology kit — materials for culturing and growing microbes in the field
2. Lab-in-a-box — general laboratory tools for maintaining sterile fields, pipetting, and processing
3. Consumables kit — sampling and processing consumables such as pipette tips and conical tubes
4. Dive kits — SCUBA-specific sampling gear and safety equipment
5. Terrestrial sampling kits — tools for soil, sediment, biomass, and plant collection

Many 2FP suitcases and field cases are insulated to double as coolers. When dry ice is required, we recommend using rotomolded hard coolers that are both impact resistant and have thick walls that can hold cold for extended periods of time. This can also serve as an alternative suitcase when empty, prior to loading with ice or dry ice.

For air travel, we recommend packing to minimize baggage volume rather than pre-packing by kit. Kits should be assembled upon arrival at the field site. All critical resources should be carried on the plane whenever possible (except for items that must legally be shipped, such as dry ice). Every checked bag must contain printed customs declarations, Material Transfer Agreements, and all relevant permits or letters of agreement.

### Cold chain and sample storage
Once site selection and experimental design are complete, teams must finalize a cold chain plan to ensure the integrity of collected samples from the moment of collection to final storage. In remote locations, sourcing dry ice can be challenging, yet it is essential for maintaining the viability of glycerol and DMSO stocks used in cryopreservation.

**If culturing and cryopreserving samples, the cold chain plan must address:**
1. Dry ice sourcing — identify nearby suppliers before deployment. Optimize for slabs over pellets, as slabs will last longer in the field.
2. Hold time — estimate how long a given quantity of dry ice will last in your cooler model (we recommend using rotomolded hard coolers that are both impact resistant and have thick walls that can hold cold for extended periods of time)
3. Refill strategies — determine how and where replenishment will occur.
4. Transit restrictions — remember that dry ice is a regulated “dangerous good” and may not be allowed on certain flights or transit routes.

When shipping with dry ice, ensure you use a carrier authorized to handle dangerous goods. In the U.S., FedEx lists these locations on its website. Always follow IATA regulations, including vented packaging and proper labeling.

In some expeditions, only DNA sequencing is planned. In these cases, cold chain demands are reduced: samples can be placed directly into an appropriate storage buffer such as Zymo Research’s DNA/RNA Shield, which allows room-temperature storage for up to one month, or longer at 4°C. This approach is logistically simpler but sacrifices the ability to culture microorganisms from the same samples.

For refrigeration without freezing, use blue ice packs to maintain ~4°C. These are preferred over wet ice, which can melt, leak, and increase contamination risk. Always ensure refrigeration or freezing capacity is available at the end of each day’s sampling. If no blue ice is available or you need more for transport, consider freezing plastic water bottles or reusable plastic bags full of water, which can be useful when you are in places with limited resources. Hard shell blue ice packs are good for longer trips, they are very durable, produce less condensation and pack well. Soft gel packs of blue ice are flexible and lightweight, however they are less durable and don’t stay cold quite as long as hard shell blue ice packs. When freezing ice packs, freeze in a standard freezer at -20°C and be mindful to not

## Protocols

## Preparing preservation buffers
Typically, each sample is aliquoted into three different buffers to preserve different fractions of the microbial community and maintain flexibility for downstream analyses:
- 50% glycerol is used to preserve heterotrophic microorganisms. Glycerol acts as a cryoprotectant, reducing ice crystal formation during freezing, which helps maintain cell integrity for culture recovery. It should be stored at -20°C or -80°C, and samples in glycerol must remain frozen until processing.
- 10% DMSO is used to preserve phototrophic organisms and certain sensitive cell types. DMSO penetrates cell membranes and protects internal structures from freezing damage, but can be toxic at higher concentrations or with prolonged exposure at non-freezing temperatures. Samples in DMSO should be frozen as quickly as possible after aliquoting, ideally on dry ice, and kept at -80°C for long-term storage.
- Zymo DNA/RNA Shield preserves DNA and RNA by stabilizing nucleic acids and inactivating nucleases and pathogens. It allows room-temperature storage for up to one month, though refrigeration or freezing is preferred for long-term stability. This buffer is particularly useful when cold chain logistics are challenging or when only molecular analyses are planned.

The following brief protocols describe the preparation of each buffer type. All tubes should be prepared and QC’d for contamination before deployment into the field. QC typically involves plating a small aliquot of each batch on nutrient agar (TSB preferred) and confirming no microbial growth after incubation. Parafilm should be used to seal tube caps to prevent leakage during transport, especially by air. For additional protection, place tubes upright in secondary containment with absorbent material if shipping liquids, and organize by buffer type for rapid access during sampling.

### Glycerol Cryovials (50%)

**Preparation**
1. Use ACS-certified glycerol stock to prepare a fresh 50% (v/v) solution in milliQ H₂O.
2. Mix thoroughly until homogeneous.
    - Invert repeatedly until the solution appears uniform with no visible streaks or layering. Avoid creating bubbles, as they can interfere with accurate volume measurement and sterilization
4. Autoclave to sterilize.
    - Dispense into a clean, autoclavable glass bottle or flask with a loose-fitting cap (do not fully tighten to avoid pressure buildup).
    - Autoclave to sterilize: run a standard liquid cycle at 121°C for 15–20 minutes at 15 psi.
    - After autoclaving, allow the solution to cool to room temperature before handling or aliquoting.
    - Tighten the cap only once the bottle has cooled completely to prevent vacuum lock.
4. Calculate total volume needed (0.75 mL per cryovial plus ~10% extra to account for pipetting loss).

**Rack Setup**

5. Arrange sterile 2.0 mL cryovials in racks; loosen lids in advance.
6. Mark each completed row with one black line across the caps to track progress.

**Aliquoting**

7. Using sterile technique and filtered pipette tips, dispense 0.75 mL per cryovial.
8. Tighten lids progressively to maintain order and efficiency.

12. After 48 hrs, if clear: update label to “cleared”
13. Store in rack or tightly re-rack into field safe boxes.

### DMSO Cryovials (10%)
**Preparation**
1. Use molecular biology grade DMSO to prepare a 10% (v/v) solution in milliQ H₂O. Always add DMSO to water, never the reverse.
