# Setting up a Field Lab

## Background
Prior to going out into the field, select and prepare the areas you will need for a smooth and efficient workflow. The four areas described below — prep, sample check-in, processing, and preservation — should be separated whenever possible to reduce cross-contamination and confusion. In small spaces, some functions may be combined, but sterile technique must be maintained. For example, [sample processing and preservation](08-sample-processing-and-preservation.md) can be done at the same table if performed by the same person in immediate sequence, within a clean working field. We recommend a closed-toe shoe-only policy in the processing and preservation areas, and lab coats in the preservation area, especially if working with an open flame.

## Protocols

### BSL-1 Field Laboratory Practices
When operating a field lab, follow Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) practices unless your work or permits require higher containment. BSL-1 standards include wearing PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection), prohibiting food and drinks in the lab space, decontaminating work surfaces before and after use, and storing reagents and samples in designated clean areas. Most environmental microbial work falls under BSL-1, but confirm whether site-specific regulations require elevated biosafety measures.

## Field Lab Stations

1. #### Field sampling prep area
- Prepare an area to assemble field equipment before departure to sampling sites. This space should be separate from sample processing and   preservation areas and large enough to stage both incoming and outgoing gear. Maintain an inventory list here for quick restocking and replacement.

2. #### Sample Check-In Area
- The sample check-in area should be clean, accessible, and close to cold storage. This is where incoming samples are received, logged, and assigned Collection IDs (CIDs). It should have a computer or tablet for digital metadata entry, labeling materials, and notebooks for backup notes. Cold storage, such as coolers or portable refrigeration, should be nearby to stabilize samples immediately. The work surface should be easy to disinfect with 10% bleach followed by 70–80% ethanol before and after each use.

3. #### Sample Processing Area
- The sample processing area is designated for pre-processing before preservation. This may involve concentrating water samples or homogenizing sediment. All tools, racks, tubes, filters, and ethanol baths should be organized and ready before starting. Keep the area free from non-sterile gear, maintain a draft-free environment, and clean all surfaces with 10% bleach (5–10 minutes contact time) followed by 70–80% ethanol before and after use.

4. #### Sample Preservation Area
- The sample preservation area is used for final steps such as aliquoting into preservatives like DNA/RNA Shield, DMSO, or glycerol. This area should have prepared cryovials, reagent stocks, pipettes, and cold chain storage such as dry ice, portable -80°C freezers, or insulated coolers. If using an open flame for sterile technique, it must be secured and stable. On vessels, flame use must be approved by the captain and a fire extinguisher should be on hand. If open flames are not permitted, use a portable HEPA-filtered clean box or rely on ethanol-based surface sterilization.

### Maintaining Sterility in the Field
Maintaining sterility in the field is critical for sample quality. Gloves should be worn at all times and changed between samples or tasks. Sterile items should not be placed on unclean surfaces; use trays or racks instead. Tubes and reagent caps must remain closed unless actively in use, and all materials should be prepared in advance to minimize open handling time. When working outdoors, position yourself upwind of dust or debris, and consider using portable shelters in windy or dusty environments.

### Waste Disposal
All waste must be handled as potentially contaminated. Solid waste such as gloves, tips, and used tubes should be placed in clearly labeled, leak-proof biohazard bags. Liquid waste, including rinse water and leftover buffers, should be collected in a dedicated, labeled container with a secure lid, treated with 10% bleach for at least 20 minutes before disposal. If autoclave access is available, autoclave solid waste prior to disposal. If not, double-bag and return waste to a facility with proper disposal capability. Local regulations, including those for marine or protected areas, must be followed at all times

| [CDC Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories](https://www.cdc.gov/labs/pdf/SF__19_308133-A_BMBL6_00-BOOK-WEB-final-3.pdf) | PDF | Published by the CDC and NIH, the BMBL is the primary U.S. reference for biosafety practices, facility standards, and risk assessments in microbiological work. It defines biosafety levels (BSL-1 to BSL-4), outlines safe handling of microorganisms, and provides guidance on decontamination, PPE, and laboratory design. While most 2FP work falls under BSL-1 or BSL-2, this manual is an essential resource for aligning field and lab protocols with established safety standards. |
