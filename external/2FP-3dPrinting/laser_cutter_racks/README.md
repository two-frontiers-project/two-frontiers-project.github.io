# Laser Cutter Racks

These SVG files are simple laser-cut designs for organizing laboratory items. They can be cut from cardboard or acrylic using a standard laser cutter.

- **Anaerobic jar cardboard rack.svg**: Holds multiple anaerobic jars upright for transport or incubation.
- **Large sample jar transport rack.svg**: A larger rack for sample bottles or other cylindrical containers.

Import the SVGs into your laser cutter's software and adjust the scale to match your material thickness.
