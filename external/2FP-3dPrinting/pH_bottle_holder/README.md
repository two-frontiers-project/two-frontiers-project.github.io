# pH Bottle Holder

A 3D-printed stand that secures a pH electrode storage bottle on the benchtop. Two versions are provided: the standard holder and a hull-based design that uses more solid material.

- **pH_bottle_holder.scad** / **.stl**: Main design files.
- **pH_bottle_holder_hull.scad** / **.stl**: Solid variant using the hull command in OpenSCAD.

Print whichever version best fits your bottle dimensions. The designs can be adjusted in OpenSCAD for different bottle diameters or heights.
