# Eyeglasses Dive Mask Mount

These files provide a custom mount that holds prescription eyeglass lenses inside a standard dive mask. The mount is designed in OpenSCAD and can be adjusted for different lens sizes or positions. SVG files are included for reference and laser cutting if desired.

- **glasses_divemask_mount_L.scad** / **.stl**: Left side mount design and corresponding STL.
- **version2_sidesL.scad** / **.stl**: Alternative version with updated geometry.
- **glasses_divemask_mount.svg** and related SVG files: 2D outlines of the mount and contact points.
- **denovo.scad**: A scratch space used to iteratively develop the design.

Print both left and right pieces, attach them to the mask, then snap the lenses into the frames. This allows wearing glasses underwater without buying an expensive prescription mask.
