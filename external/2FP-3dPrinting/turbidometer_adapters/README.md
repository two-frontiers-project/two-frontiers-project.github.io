# Turbidometer Adapters

Adapters for connecting standard test tubes to a commercial turbidometer, allowing measurements without dedicated cuvettes. Several versions are provided for different test tube sizes and turbidometer models.

- **testtube_to_OD600_v1.scad** / **.stl**: Adapter for measuring optical density at 600 nm using a standard test tube.
- **testtube_to_turbidometer_v1.scad** / **.stl**: First-generation adapter model.
- **testtube_to_turbidometer_v2.scad** / **.stl**: Improved second-generation design.
- **testtube_to_turbidometer_v1.snap3dp.gz**: Snapshot of printer settings for replicating the print.

Print the adapter that matches your test tube and instrument, then insert the tube to take measurements without transferring to a cuvette.
