# Microscope Mount for Fiber Spectrophotometer

A custom adapter that mounts an Ocean Optics fiber spectrophotometer probe onto a standard laboratory microscope. This allows collection of spectra directly from microscope samples.

- **OcenOpticsSpecMicroscopeMount2.scad** / **.stl**: OpenSCAD source and STL model for printing.

Print the mount, attach the fiber probe, and clamp it to the microscope eyepiece. Adjust parameters in the SCAD file if your microscope or probe dimensions differ.
