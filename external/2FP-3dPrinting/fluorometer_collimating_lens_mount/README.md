# Fluorometer Collimating Lens Mount

This design holds a collimating lens for a fluorometer, allowing fiber-optic measurements to be precisely aligned. Two versions are provided: the main mount and a spacer that can be added for additional lens clearance.

- **Flourolog_FiberOpticColim.scad** / **.stl**: Base OpenSCAD design and STL for the mount.
- **Flourolog_FiberOpticColim_spacer.scad** / **.stl**: Optional spacer piece.

Use these parts to attach a lens to the optical path of a fluorometer or spectrometer. The model can be adjusted in OpenSCAD if different lens diameters or offsets are required.
