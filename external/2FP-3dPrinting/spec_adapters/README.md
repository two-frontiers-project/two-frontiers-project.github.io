# Spectrophotometer Adapters

Adapters and stands for connecting cuvettes and other sample holders to spectrophotometers. The designs are parametric OpenSCAD files with corresponding STL and G-code outputs.

- **cly.scad** / **.stl** / **.gcode**: Adapter for cylindrical cuvettes.
- **stand.scad** / **.stl** / **.gcode**: A sturdy stand for holding the adapter at the correct height.
- **stand_simple.scad** / **.stl** / **.gcode**: Simplified stand option.
- **preview.png**: Rendered preview of the assembled adapter and stand.

Use these prints to interface custom samples with your spectrophotometer or to hold optical fibers at the appropriate location.
