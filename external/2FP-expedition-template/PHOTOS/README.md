# Expedition Template - Photos

> **Repository:** [2FP-expedition-template](https://github.com/two-frontiers-project/2FP-expedition-template)

---

Save all photos taken during the expedition here.
We recommend:
- Subfolders for scientific versus general expedition photos
- Consistent filename conventions (e.g., YYYYMMDD_location_sampleID.jpg)
- Storing raw and processed versions separately if edits are made
Large image sets can be compressed before syncing to this repository.
