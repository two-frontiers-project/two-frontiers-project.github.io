# Two Frontiers Project (2FP) - Open Tools & Protocols

## About the Two Frontiers Project

The Two Frontiers Project (2FP) is a collaborative research initiative focused on developing open-source tools, protocols, and methodologies for environmental and biological research. Our mission is to make scientific tools and protocols accessible to researchers worldwide through comprehensive documentation and open-source implementations.

> **Note:** This site contains research protocols and tools that are currently under development. All materials, protocols, and software are intended for research purposes only.

The Two Frontiers Field Handbook is our comprehensive guide that defines our standards and practices for field research methodology and enables  interoperability across research teams worldwide. This handbook represents the culmination of years of collaborative research and field experience, providing standardized protocols that ensure data quality and comparability across diverse research environments. In addition to downloading it, you can work with the embedded version directly in this site.

### What's Inside the Handbook

The handbook covers the complete research workflow from expedition planning to post-sampling analysis:

1. **About This Handbook** - Introduction, scope, and how to use this resource
2. **Expedition Planning** - Comprehensive planning guidelines and checklists
3. **Sample Identifiers & Site Metadata** - Standardized data collection protocols
4. **Preparation for Sample Collection** - Pre-fieldwork setup and equipment preparation
5. **Field Lab Setup** - Establishing processing facilities in remote locations
6. **Sample Collection** - Detailed collection protocols and best practices
7. **Sample Check-in** - Documentation and initial processing procedures
8. **Sample Processing & Preservation** - Laboratory protocols and storage methods
9. **Sample Transportation** - Safe transport and chain of custody procedures
10. **Post-Sampling Reset & Team Debrief** - Expedition closure and data review

## What You'll Find on the rest of This Site

The rest of the 2FP Open Tools resource aggregates our software, protocols, and repositories in a structured format. The goal here is that you reproduce our field sampling, sequencing, and analysis according to our standards such that your data lines up with the network of teams using 2FP protocols, enabling easier analysis.

*Please note:* We did NOT make all of these tools ourselves -- most of the hardware, for example, is from forked and/or lightly modified repositories. Please see individual repositories for correct attribution and, if you use these specific tools in your work, cite the authors.
