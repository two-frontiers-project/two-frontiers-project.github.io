# Two Frontiers Project (2FP) - Open Tools & Protocols

## About the Two Frontiers Project

The Two Frontiers Project is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit research initiative leveraging the diversity of life in extreme environments to address major challenges in human and planetary health, including bioremediation, coral reef bleaching, sustainable agriculture, and drug discovery. Through global expeditions and community-based citizen science programs, we connect scientists, explorers, and innovators to unlock the potential of naturally evolved microbes. Our research underpins solutions to urgent environmental issuesâ€”from discovering carbon-fixing microorganisms in the volcanic ocean vents of the Mediterranean to searching contaminated sites for organisms capable of removing contaminants from the environment. We specialize in sampling, precision culturomics, and sequencing, and we continuously screen our dataset for microbes capable of producing potentially industrially or pharmacologically utile compounds.  

On this site, you can find resources related to the work we do, including our fieldwork handbook, software tools, custom sampling equipment, expedition planning documentation, and so on.

## What You'll Find on This Site
