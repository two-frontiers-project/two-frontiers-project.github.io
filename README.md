# Two Frontiers Project (2FP) - Open Tools & Protocols

## About the Two Frontiers Project

The Two Frontiers Project (2FP) is a collaborative research initiative focused on developing open-source tools, protocols, and methodologies for environmental and biological research. Our mission is to make scientific tools and protocols accessible to researchers worldwide through comprehensive documentation and open-source implementations.

> **Note:** This site contains research protocols and tools that are currently under development. All materials, protocols, and software are intended for research purposes only.

## What You'll Find on This Site

This comprehensive resource aggregates our tools and protocols, and repositories in a structured format. The goal here is that you reproduce our field sampling, sequencing, and analysis according to our standards such that your data lines up with the network of teams using 2FP protocols, enabling easier analysis.

*Please note:* We did NOT make all of these tools ourselves -- most of the hardware, for example, is from forked and/or lightly modified repositories. Please see individual repositories for correct attribution and, if you use these specific tools in your work, cite the authors.

## Site Structure

### Field/Sampling Protocols
- **Field Kits & Protocols**: Core field sampling protocols, slates, and materials

- **PUMA Scope**: Portable microscopy solutions
- **Cuvette Holder**: Custom laboratory equipment designs
- **Open Colorimeter**: Colorimetric analysis tools

### Software
Research software tools and applications:
- **XTree**: Phylogenetic analysis tools
- **MAGUS**: Metagenomic analysis and processing tools

### Templates
Standardized templates for field work and data collection:
- **Expedition Template**: Template for organizing and documenting field expeditions
